# Wall Cavity Barrier (Red Edition) meets masonry construction challenge

In medium to high-rise buildings where the external facade is masonry, brickwork may require structural support—typically in the form of steel support shelves. However, these support shelves are often located precisely where a cavity barrier should be positioned, creating a challenging installation scenario.

Recent testing has shown that this challenge can be overcome with AIM – Acoustic & Insulation Manufacturing’s new **Wall Cavity Barrier (Red Edition)**. Launched in summer 2024, this innovative product is designed for use as either a cavity barrier or a cavity closer within the external wall structure, effectively preventing the passage of heat, flame, and smoke. It is available in fire ratings of 30, 60, or 120 minutes, and its extended fire rating makes it ideal for both vertical and horizontal applications along fire compartmentation lines in medium to high-rise buildings.

In order to address the difficulty of installing a barrier in tandem with masonry support shelves, the Wall Cavity Barrier (Red Edition) has been tested with a Leviat-designed masonry support shelf under challenging conditions. The tests varied the penetration level of the masonry bracket into the barrier, and results confirmed that the Wall Cavity Barrier (Red Edition) can achieve up to 120 minutes of EI (Integrity and Insulation) performance.

“The outcome of the testing is that our Wall Cavity Barrier (Red Edition) may be fitted at the top or bottom of the floor slab, with the masonry support shelf tested with a 50% to 140% penetration through the cavity barrier line. This offers installers much more flexibility when integrating both the support shelf and the barrier,” explains AIM’s commercial director Ian Exall.

The testing was conducted in accordance with BS EN 1366-4:2021, the recognized fire resistance standard for cavity barriers in the UK and EU. Additional tests included masonry and steel frame systems (SFS), and AIM has invested in third-party certification from UKAS accredited IFC Certification Ltd for masonry activities.

Wall Cavity Barrier (Red Edition) is capable of filling voids up to 600mm in masonry construction. It has also been tested in SFS construction and rainscreen cladding. The product is supplied in slab form, allowing for on-site cutting or pre-cut sizing. It is available in slabs 600mm and 1200mm wide, with thickness options of 75, 100, and 125mm. Often, it is used in conjunction with AIM’s Open State Cavity Barriers (OSCBs).

AIM not only provides this robust product but also offers comprehensive technical support, including detailed specifications, training, and on-site assistance.
