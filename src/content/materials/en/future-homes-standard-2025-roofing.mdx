# Future Homes Standard 2025: Transforming Roofing and Insulation

## Core Requirements

The Future Homes Standard (FHS) introduces stringent requirements for new homes built from 2025:

- 75-80% reduction in carbon emissions vs present
- Enhanced ventilation systems
- Improved energy efficiency standards
- Focus on fabric-first approach
- Optimized thermal performance
- Proactive modifications by industry leaders
- Comprehensive sustainability approach

## Key Components

### Roofing Solutions
- Concrete tiles as traditional option
- Terracotta tiles for aesthetic appeal
- Fiber-cement slates gaining market share
- Solar panel compatibility planning
- 25% of heat loss through roof
- Proper ventilation essential
- No mandatory solar panel requirements yet
- Logical planning for future integration

### Facade Materials
- Timber construction options
- Stone facades for durability
- Vinyl cladding solutions
- Metal systems integration
- Weatherboard alternatives
- Fiber cement advantages:
  - Strong and versatile
  - Sustainable composition
  - Lower raw material usage
  - Reduced energy in manufacture
  - Less waste production
  - A1 fire classification
  - Extreme temperature resistance
  - Low maintenance requirements

### Common Combinations
- Ground floor render
