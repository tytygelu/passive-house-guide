# Future Homes Standards 2025 and the Juwo SmartWall Solution

The new **Future Homes Standards 2025** aim to revolutionize the way we design and construct new homes in the UK by significantly improving thermal efficiency and reducing running costs. In doing so, the standards strive to lower the carbon footprint of new homes by addressing critical factors such as:

- **Carbon Emissions**
- **Primary Energy Use**
- **Fabric Energy Efficiency**

The proposed consultation will take a close look at the Notional Dwelling specification and evaluate key parameters like U-values, thermal bridging (Psi Values), and the thermal mass of the building. These factors affect not only internal comfort and solar gains, but also the overall airtightness of the property.

## The Challenge of Traditional Construction

Traditional masonry cavity wall construction often struggles to meet the demanding U-values required by the 2025 standards. Achieving target U-values (circa 0.15 W/m²K) with conventional methods can necessitate excessive wall thickness—upwards of 430–450 mm with large insulation cavities—resulting in design complications, increased foundation sizes, and additional structural reinforcements.

## The Juwo SmartWall Advantage

The answer may lie in innovative construction systems like the **Juwo SmartWall**. This monolithic single skin system integrates insulation directly within the clay blocks, minimizing thermal bridging and eliminating the need for:

- Cavities
- Wall ties
- Additional external insulation

By incorporating insulation within the block itself and using a thin-bed adhesive for jointing, the Juwo SmartWall system offers a streamlined, cost-effective construction solution that meets rigorous energy performance standards.

## Key Benefits

- **Excellent Thermal Performance:** Achieves U-values as low as 0.11 W/m²K
- **Regulation Compliance:** Meets and exceeds building regulation requirements
- **Faster Construction:** Single solid wall design accelerates build times
- **Modern Method of Construction:** Utilizes thin bed mortar technology and complete building packages
- **Sustainability:** Uses clay—a natural, sustainable material—with reduced water usage
- **Versatility:** Suitable for both low- and high-rise developments, as well as self-build projects
- **Simplified Detailing:** A thermal bridge-free construction method with fewer detailing challenges

## In Summary

As the construction industry gears up for the Future Homes Standards 2025, embracing innovative systems like Juwo SmartWall can play a crucial role in achieving high thermal efficiency and reducing construction times and costs.
